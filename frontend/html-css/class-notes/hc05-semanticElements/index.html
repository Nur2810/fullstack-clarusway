                Music has been a part of human culture for thousands of years. From ancient instruments to modern
                digital music, it has evolved tremendously over time.

                the diverse world of music we enjoy today.</p>

            <p>Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making music is the process of putting sounds and
                tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified composition. People who make music
                creatively organize sounds for a desired result, like a Beethoven symphony or one of Duke Ellington's
                jazz songs.</p>
